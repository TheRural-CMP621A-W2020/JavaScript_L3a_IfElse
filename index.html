		<h3> Student Exercises</h3>
		<ol>
			
			<li>	Rewrite the first example with an if/else statement so that if the color and font change from yellow and small to red and xx-large it can be reversed back to yellow and small by clicking the button again.
			<li>Create an input box so a user can enter the radius of a circle and the program will calculate the area and circumference. The radius should pass through the function. Hint: Remember parseInt() and parseFloat() from last week.function. Call the function by clicking on a button.
